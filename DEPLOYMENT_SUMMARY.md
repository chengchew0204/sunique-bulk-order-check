## 🔑 Important Environment Variables

### Railway Backend
You'll need to set these in Railway dashboard:

```
SHAREPOINT_TENANT_ID=...
SHAREPOINT_CLIENT_ID=...
SHAREPOINT_CLIENT_SECRET=...
SHAREPOINT_OBJECT_ID=...
INFLOW_COMPANY_ID=...
INFLOW_API_KEY=...
SECRET_KEY=... (generate a strong random key)
```

### Netlify Frontend
You'll need to set this in Netlify dashboard:

```
API_BASE_URL=https://your-railway-backend.railway.app/api
```

---

## ✅ Verification Steps

After deployment, verify everything works:

1. **Backend Health Check**
   - Visit: `https://your-railway-app.railway.app/api/health`
   - Should return: `{"status": "ok", "message": "Bulk Order API is running"}`

2. **Frontend Loading**
   - Visit your Netlify URL
   - Page should load without errors

3. **End-to-End Test**
   - Upload a test Excel file
   - Process the file
   - Verify results display
   - Download Excel results

## 🆘 Need Help?

### Quick Issues

**"Railway deployment failed"**
→ Check Railway logs for specific errors
→ Verify all environment variables are set

**"Netlify build failed"**
→ Check build logs
→ Verify `API_BASE_URL` is set in environment variables

**"Frontend can't connect to backend"**
→ Check browser console for CORS errors
→ Verify Railway backend is running (check health endpoint)
→ Ensure `API_BASE_URL` is correct (includes `/api` at the end)
